Software License I picked: GNU General Public License v3.0

Reason I picked license: the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee my freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

Any closed-sourced system is paid for

Linux bluetooth: open source

GPL license is about community community community!!!!!!!

The great lie regards with software is "I have read the terms and terms and conditions".
