title: 5.5 Notes - Legal and Ethnical Concerns
---
## License Types
 - Creative Commons Zero: waives copyright interest in a work created and it is dedicated to the world-wide public domain
 - Open Source MIT License: the author of software with MIT license wants credit
 - Open Source GPL License: the license lets people do whatever they want with their project, except distributing closed-source versions 

## Legal and Ethnic Concerns
 - creative commons: open-sourced code lets us to learn a lot for free
 - Digital Rights Management = downloading music, movies, and other content from illegal websites that have bybassed the systems
 - Digital Rights Management is often violated
 - The type of license I like best is the open source GPL license
 
Software License I picked: GNU General Public License v3.0

Reason I picked license: the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee my freedom to share and change all versions of a program to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

Any closed-sourced system is paid for

Linux bluetooth: open source

GPL license is about community community community!!!!!!!

The great lie regards with software is "I have read the terms and terms and conditions".
