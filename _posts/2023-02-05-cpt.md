## Overview
My feature is the BMI calculator. A solution to solving an unhealthy lifestyle is finding ways to regulate your body mass. To do this, you need to first find your body mass index. This problem is solved with our BMI Calculator, which will tell you, based on the input of your height weight, whether you are underweight, normal weight, or overweight for your index.
## Program Function and Purpose
purpose: to solve obesity and being underweight
functionality: calculate body mass index
input: both weight and height of person
output: BMI and tips on how to get BMI normalized
## Data Abstraction
Add a button called “add BMI” that will add to a list called BMIs and can be displayed on the table. This is incorporated to lists.
## Managing Complexity
For the managing complexity category, I have to use functions to code everything and important code is put inside primary functions.
## Procedural Abstraction
Use a procedure to calculate BMIs.
## Algorithm and Implementation
using sequencing to calculate BMI based on users' inputs
## Testing
your own weight and height would be more than enough to test it fairly.
