## Overview
My feature is the BMI calculator. A solution to solving an unhealthy lifestyle is finding ways to regulate your body mass. To do this, you need to first find your body mass index. This problem is solved with our BMI Calculator, which will tell you, based on the input of your height weight, whether you are underweight, normal weight, or overweight for your index.

## Program Function and Purpose
 - purpose: to solve obesity and being underweight
 - functionality: calculate body mass index
 - input: both weight and height of person
 - output: BMI and tips on how to get BMI normalized

## Data Abstraction
Add a button called "add BMI" that will add to a list called BMIs and can be displayed on the table. This is incorporated to lists. I am still working with my team on that.

## Video Plan
For the BMI calculator, I will type in the weight and height of the person, and the BMI will show up. If I type in each BMI, each BMI will show up in the displayed table.
