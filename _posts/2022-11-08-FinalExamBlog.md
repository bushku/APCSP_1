![Question 43.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Question 43.png "https://github.com/bushku/APCSP_1")

I was having a bit of trouble with that question, but ended up getting the correct answer.

Reason for correct answer: Variables x and result are initialized to zero. Inside the loop, the result is increased by x and x is increased by 1. The loop ends when x is greater than 5. Therefore, the result is the sum of the integers 0 to 5, which is 15.

Question 44 is my favorite question in the exam because it involves modular arithmetic. I learned it in AOPS (Art of Problem Solving). Modular Arithmetic is my favorite topic ever!!!!!!!!

That was a "values of variables after arithmetic operations" type of question. That question reminds me of doing plug and chug in the problems I did in Algebra class.


## Night at the Museum Reflection
 When I saw other groups' projects, they were running games. The games were my favorite projects I saw because it reminded me of playing video games when I was little. I still play a video game called "Subway Surfers" but only for a little while because I do have to finish work.
