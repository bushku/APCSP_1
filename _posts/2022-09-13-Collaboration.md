 - Explain how computing innovations are improved through collaboration
 - Demonstrate effective interpersonal skills during collaboration
 - Explain how computing innovations are developed by groups of people

## How to Collaborate in Class
 - Pair Programming: Two programmers work together as a pair. One (the driver) writes program code, while the other (the observer, pointer, or navigator) reviews each line of program code as it is typed in.
 - Think-Pair-Share: Students tink through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results to the class

## Leave Comments in Code
 - Communicate to your partner(s)
 - Communicate to yourself
 - Acknowledge code segments used from other sources
 - Acknowledge media used from other sources
 - Differentiate what you and your partner(s) did
 - Clarify the functionality of your code

## Online Tools
 - repl.it: multiplayer
 - GitHub: collaboration and repository
 - Shared document or folder
 - Ask friends and family to test drive your program and give you feedback

## Facebook
 - At facebook, there is a lot of different departments
 - There's people that do art, sound and video
 - Android development, IOS development, and all these people have to get together, not just coders to figure out what's best for the public
 - does own Instogram, WhatsApp, Oculus, many different entities that require so many moving parts and together
 - Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it
 - A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function
 - A computing innovation can be physical or a nonphysical computing concept



## Takeaway Thoughts
Interpersonal skills learned through collaboration:
 - Communication
 - Consensus Building
