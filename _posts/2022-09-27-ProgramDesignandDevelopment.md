title:  Program Design and Development

## How is a Program Developed?
 - starts with an idea
 - developed with a specific purpose in mind
 - developers follow specific steps and stick to plan
 - sometimes development is more exploratory than anything, and steps are dictated by what happens (both good & bad)
## Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect
 - Investigation - important step in process
 - Developers must determine requirements of program, understand constraints, and understand user concerns & interests
## How developers investigate
 - surveys
 - user testing
 - interviews
 - direct observations
 After initial investigation & reflection,developers design program by:
 - brainstorming (draw on investigation)
 - storyboarding program
 - planning user experience
 - laying out user interface
 - organizing into modules
 - develop testing strategy
Developers decide on program requirements that:
 - describe how a program should behave
 - include a list of user interactions
Developers create prototype of program (or components):
 - an incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts(modules) of program
## We test the program
 - testing occurs at micro level & macro level
 - Developers refine & revise thru testing, feedback, & reflection
 - Program development is rarely a solo endeavor
 - programs are usually developed by teams of people
 - individuals/teams work on different functional components
 - Each member of project deserves to receive credit for their work
 - Names must be written in documentation of program including contributions to project
## Why documentation is an important place to give credit
 - Many projects use comments within programming language to give credit
 - documentation is the important part of development of program
 - When developers find an error in a program, they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem
 - This may be most useful after a program is completed, & users find additional bugs
Many times developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms, & more that are written by others
 - These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited
 - This is similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article
 - Any code segments, procedures, algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author
 - The program documentation should include the author's name and the source of any code segments being used
 - This protion of the documentation may resemble a bibliography or a works cited page in a research paper
## How do programmers document while programming?
 - Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not
 - commenting allows programmers to write text within the program
 - this text doesn't affect the program
 - comments are for programmers to read
 - this is a form of documentation and can be useful when programmers collaborate or work individually
