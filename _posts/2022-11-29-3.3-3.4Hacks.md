## Hack 1

Sequence: a list of steps
selection: selecting a string/number
iteration: doing a loop over again until condition is met
 - All the numbers are sequencing
 - 3 & 4 are selection
 - 2 & 4 are iteration

## Hack 2
num1 = 5
num2 = num1 * 3 = 5(3) = 15
num3 = num2 / num1 * (9 % 2) * 4 = 3 * 1 * 4 = 12
result = (num3 % num1 + num2) % num3 * 3 / 5 = (12 % 5 + 15) % 12 * 3/5 = 17 % 12 * 3/5 = 3

1 down - iteration
2 down - selection
3 across - sequence

## Hack 3
