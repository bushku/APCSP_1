## Notes
Sequence: a list of steps to achieve result

selection: allows an algorithm to make a decision based on if a condition is met

iteration: doing a loop over again until condition is met
## Hack 1
 - All the numbers are sequencing because they are the steps to achieve result
 - 3 & 4 are selection because it means allowing an algorithm to make a decision based on if a condition is met
 - 2 & 4 are iteration because it means a loops is made many times until condition is met
## Notes
## Example with Use of MODULUS 

```python
num1 = 12
num2 = 25
num3 = 14
result = num1 / 4 * num3 + 9 % 2 - num3
print(result)
```

The output of the result is 29

## Hack 2
num1 = 5

num2 = num1 * 3 = 5(3) = 15

num3 = num2 / num1 * (9 % 2) * 4 = 3 * 1 * 4 = 12

result = (num3 % num1 + num2) % num3 * 3 / 5 = (12 % 5 + 15) % 12 * 3/5 = 17 % 12 * 3/5 = 3


1 down - iteration

2 down - selection

3 across - sequence

## Notes
This is an example of a len substring in python:

len("HelloWorld")
The output is 10 because there are 10 letters in the string

This is an example of a concat string in python:

string1 = "Hello"

string2 = "World"

print(string1 + string2)

The output is HelloWorld

"Challenge" problem:

(The first to answer the output.)

string1 = "degree"

string2 = " passenger"

FinalString = string1 + string2

print(FinalString[2:9])

print(len(FinalString))

print(len(FinalString[2:9]))

The outputs are gree pa, 16, and 7
