## What Will We Learn?
 - Describe the purpose of a computing innovation
 - Identify input(s) to a program
 - Identify output(s) produced by a program

## Essential Knowledge
 - The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression
 - An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation
 - Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text.
 - An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program.
 - Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution
 - Inputs usually affect the output produced by the program
 - In event-driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered rather than through the sequential flow of control
 - Inputs can come from a user or other programs
 - Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device. Program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text.
 - Program output is usually based on a program's input or prior state (e.g. internal values)

## What types of input do your devices accept?
  - Smart Phone/Tablet
  - Laptop/Computer
  - Gaming Console
## How do programs receive input?
Most Programs are written in an event driven environment.
 - "Events" are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program
 - Inputs usually affect outputs
What type of "events" can use a trigger?
 - mouse clicks
 - screen taps/swipes
 - physical button clicks
 - keyboard entries
 - audio trigger
 
## Computing Innovations
 
### Categories of Innovations
  - Applications
    1. Games
    2. Social Media: Allows users to connect from a distance and archive their activities
    3. Business
    4. Productivity
  - Physical Devices
    1. Computers
    2. Smart Phones/Tablets
    3. Smart "Things"
    4. Wearables
  - Systems
    1. E-commerce: Allows users to save time and money by being able to shop from home
    2. Cloud Services
    3. E-mail
  - Digital Assistant Devices allow users to control their devices hands-free, making them safer while driving or more convenient when trying to multitask
## Innovations Created for a Purpose
### Guiding Questions
1. Why Does Computing Innovation Exist?
2. What problem(s) does the computing innovation solve?
3. What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not do before? 

## How does a program know what to do upon an event?
An action triggers to an event:
 - Action may be initiated by the user or another program/device

The program "jumps" to the code segment according to the event:
 - The code segment is executed
 - Output is triggered by code segment
The program code is not necessarily executed "in order":
 - Code segments are executed as they are called, according to the events triggered

I had difficulties with question 1: Which of the following best describes the behavior of the code segment?
