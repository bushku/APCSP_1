## Submission 1

Program Function and Purpose: Student score is 1/1 and college board score is 0/1.

Data Abstraction: Student score is 1/1 and college board score is 1/1.

Managing Complexity: Student score is 1/1 and college board score is 0/1.   

Procedural Abstraction: Student score is 1/1 and college board score is 1/1.

Algorithm Implementation: Student score is 1/1 and college board score is 1/1. 

Testing: Student score is 1/1 and college board score is 1/1.

## Reflection 1
Discrepancies: I am surprised that college board score the CPT at 4/6 instead of 6/6. On the Program Function and Purpose category, the written response did not describe the program's purpose. It instead describes the function of the program, "to provide information about a triangle based on inputted side lengths". The category met the rest of the criteria. I scored 1/1 because I thought the student was describing the function and purpose by stating "to provide information about a triangle based on inputted side lengths", but it turns out that college board scored 0/1 acccording to the reason stated above. For the Managing Complexity category, I gave 1/1 because I thought the student managed complexity but it turned out that the student actually got 0/1 because the response includes a list that collects the four possible classifications in one place, but this is not necessary for the program.

What my program will need: My program will need to meet all of the requirements. If I miss even one point of the reporting category, I will get a 0 on the category.

Why the submission might have failed: The submission may have failed because college board took a point off due to the lack of explaining the program function and purpose and a point off due to the lack of explaining managing complexity.

Data Abstraction: Student score is 1/1 and college board score is 1/1.

Managing Complexity: Student score is 1/1 and college board score is 1/1.   

Procedural Abstraction: Student score is 1/1 and college board score is 1/1.

Testing: Student score is 1/1 and college board score is 1/1.

## Reflection 2
Discrepancies: I scored the Program Function and Purpose category as 0/1 instead of 1/1 because I thought the program in the video did not include any inputs. It turns out that college board scored the category as 1/1 because the video shows input into the program through the user placing tiles on a grid. 

What my program will need: My create performance task will need to be detailed and precise in the written response.

Why the submission did not fail: The submission did not fail because the student met all the requirements.
