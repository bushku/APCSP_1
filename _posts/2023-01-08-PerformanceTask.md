## Submission 1

| Reporting Category     | Student Score    | College Board Score  |
|  -----------------     | ---------------- | -------------------  | 
| Program Function and Purpose  | 1 | 0 | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 |
| Testing | 1 | 1 |
## Reflection 1
I am surprised that college board score the CPT at 4/6 instead of 6/6. On the Program Function and Purpose category, the written response did not describe the program's purpose. It instead describes the function of the program, "to provide information about a triangle based on inputted side lengths." The category met the rest of the criteria. I scored 1/1 because I thought the student was describing the function and purpose by stating "to provide information about a triangle based on inputted side lengths", but it turns out that college board scored 0/1 acccording to the reason stated above. For the Managing Complexity category, I gave 1/1 because I thought the student managed complexity but it turned out that the student actually got 0/1 because the response includes a list that collects the four possible classifications in one place, but this is not necessary for the program.

I scored the Program Function and Purpose category as 0/1 instead of 1/1 because I thought the program in the video did not include any inputs. It turns out that college board scored the category as 1/1 because
