Three components of an algorithm:
 - sequence
 - selection
 - Iteration
It is important to know that algorithms can be written in different ways in a way they can do the same thing because the outputs are the same in different ways.
It is important to know that algorithms that look the same might have different results because the outputs are different even though the codes are almost the same.

## Examples
```python
print("What Grade Did You Get?")
grade = int(input(79))
if grade >= 95:
        print("Wow! Good job!")
if 70 <= grade < 95:
        print("Nice!")
elif grade < 70:
        print("Do Better")
```
## How Nested Conditionals are Related to Boolean Expressions
The following 2 pieces of code are supposed to print "don't go to school" unless:
```python
isLatestart = False
isEarlyStart = True


if isLatestart == True:
    print("go to school late!")


else:
    if isEarlyStart == True:
        print("go to school early!")
    
    else:
        print("go to school late!")
```

```python
isLatestart = False
isEarlyStart = True


driveSchool = not(isLatestart) and isEarlyStart
if driveSchool == False:
    print("go to school late!")
if driveSchool == True:
    print("go to school early!")
```
## Developing Algorithms
When creating an algorithm, it is extremely important to outline the process before coding.

```python
print("The parking rate is as follows: \n Less than one hour: Free \n 1-2 hours: $5 \n 2-3 hours: $8 \n 3-4 hours: $10 \n 4+ hours: $12")

time = float(input("How many hours have you parked at this garage?"))
print("How many hours have you parked at this garage?")
print(time, "hours costs:")

if time < 1 :
    print("Free")
elif time >= 1 and time < 2 :
    print("$5")
elif time >= 2 and time < 3 :
    print("$8")
elif time >= 3 and time < 4 :
    print("$10")
else:
    print("$12")

print("Have a good day!")
```

## Guessing Game Hacks
```python
import random

#sets variables for the game
num_guesses = 0
user_guess = 0
upper_bound = 100
lower_bound = 0

#generates a random number
number = random.randint(1,100)

# print(number)     #for testing purposes
print(number)
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

#Write a function that gets a guess from the user using input()
def guess():
    g = int(input("Choose a number"))
    return g #add something here 

#Change the print statements to give feedback on whether the player guessed too high or too low
def search(number, guess):
    global lower_bound, upper_bound
    if guess < number:
        print("Higher, your getting there") #change this
        lower_bound = guess
    elif guess > number:
        print("Lower, your getting closer") #change this
        upper_bound = guess
    return lower_bound, upper_bound

while user_guess != number:
    user_guess = guess()
    num_guesses += 1
    print(f"You guessed {user_guess}.")
    lower_bound, upper_bound = search(number, user_guess)
    print(f"Guess a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.")

print(f"You guessed the number in {num_guesses} guesses!")
```

```python
One = [12,14,44,57,79,80,99]
Two = [92,43,74,66,30,12,1]
Three = [7,13,96,111,33,84,60]
Lists = [One, Two, Three]
# loops through the range of the length of lists
for x in range(len(Lists)):
    #sorts the list in order
    Lists[x].sort()
    #takes the middle index 
    middleindex = int(len(Lists[x])/2)
    #outputs
    print("Middle Index of List #",x+1,"is",Lists[x][middleindex])
```
Middle Index of List # 1 is 57
Middle Index of List # 2 is 43
Middle Index of List # 3 is 60

Set 1: 80, Set 2: 74, Set 3: 96

Which of the following lists can NOT a binary search be used in order to find a targeted value?

a. ["amy", "beverly", "christian", "devin"]

b. [-1, 2, 6, 9, 19]

c. [3, 2, 8, 12, 99]

d. ["xylophone", "snowman", "snake", "doorbell", "author"]

c is out of order so therefore it is c
