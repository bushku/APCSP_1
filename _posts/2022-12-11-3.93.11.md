Three components of an algorithm:
 - sequence
 - selection
 - Iteration
It is important to know that algorithms can be written in different ways in a way they can do the same thing because the outputs are the same in different ways.
It is important to know that algorithms that look the same might have different results because the outputs are different even though the codes are almost the same.

## Examples
```python
print("What Grade Did You Get?")
grade = int(input(79))
if grade >= 95:
        print("Wow! Good job!")
if 70 <= grade < 95:
        print("Nice!")
elif grade < 70:
        print("Do Better")
```
