## Computers Use Binary
 - The binary number system has 2 numbers (0 and 1)
## Binary Numbers
 - a number system that uses two digits
 - 1: an electrical signal in computer being on
 - 0: an electrical signal in computer being off
 - Binary digit: the smallest unit of data in computing
 - Byte: group of 8 bits
## Binary Numbers and the Physical Processes of a Computer
 - Circuits in a computer's processor are made up of billions of transistors
 - Digits 0 and 1 used in binary reflect the electrical signal being on and off
 - All software, music, documents, and any other information that is processed by a computer is stored in sequences of binary
 - The way a binary sequence is used is interpreted depends on how it will be used
 - A byte of information like 0100 1001 is used to represent instructions to the computer
## Binary Numbers Represent Instructions
 - Important to remember - the 1s and 0s can represent ANYTHING
## Digital Data and Abstractions
 - At lowest level, bits represent all digital data
 - Abstraction reduces complexity and allows us to focus on the main idea or larger problem
 - Analog: a mechanism, device, or technology that represents data by measurement of a continuous physical variable
 - The use of digital data to approximate real world analog data is an example of abstraction
## Integers Are Represented by a Fixed Number of Bits
 - All data is represented by 1s and 0s arranged in groups called bytes
a) This includes integers - whole numbers, even and odd, including 0
 - Integers are represented in computers by a fixed number of bits
a) Examples:
 1. Some programming languages store data values in up to 32 bits (or 4 bytes)
 2. 4 bytes can represent 2^32 different values or a little over 4 billion different values total
## Overflow Error
 - If a program encounters a calculation that requires a number larger than what it's memory will allow to be stored, this can result an overflow error
## Round-off Error
 - Programming languages can have problems with real numbers like pi
## Computer's Available Memory
 - Ideal situation: the range of numbers a computer can work with would only be limited by the computer's available memory
 - Real world: this is not always possible
a) If a number stretches towards infinity, it would require an infinite amount of computer memory in order to store and calculate
