| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | My program has clearly labeled, has an input, output, and works |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | List was named well, I have two code segments, that collects data and shows the list in whater getID is picked |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The first part of the code manges complexity, and can be made using if staments instead of cases |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Calls the Add() and Tasks() is called inside the Add(), The Add() adds whatever text is given from the input and day, the tasks is called at the end of the Add() to check if the data that was added can also be added to the Daily Taks |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Uses squencing selection and iteration with the Add(), The algorthim can be made very easily and the code for it is shown below.
| Testing | 1 | 1 | The program calls two different functions and the text it gives back clearly shows the result. |
| Final | 6/6 | 6/6 | |

## Feature
My feature is the BMI calculator. A solution to solving an unhealthy lifestyle is finding ways to regulate your body mass. To do this, you need to first find your body mass index. This problem is solved with our BMI Calculator, which will tell you, based on the input of your height weight, whether you are underweight, normal weight, or overweight for your index.

## Code Plan
I will talk to my groupmates about how lists will be incorporated in the code plan. The main idea for the code plan is to calculate the body mass index by using both weight and height of the person.  The procedure of the code includes calculating the body mass index with the famous BMI formula and stores that value with the user account if the user wishes. 

## Video Plan
For the BMI calculator, I will type in the weight and height of the person, and the BMI will show up.

function create_User(){
    // extract data from inputs
    const name = document.getElementById("name").value;
    const email = document.getElementById("email").value;
    const password = document.getElementById("password").value;
    const phone = document.getElementById("phone").value;
    const requestOptions = {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': 'Bearer my-token',
        },
    };
    //url for Create API
    const url='/crud_api/create/' + name + '/' + email+ '/' + password + '/' + phone;
    //Async fetch API call to the database to create a new user
    fetch(url, requestOptions).then(response => {
        // prepare HTML search result container for new output
        const resultContainer = document.getElementById("result");
        // trap error response from Web API
        if (response.status !== 200) {
            const errorMsg = 'Database response error: ' + response.status;
            console.log(errorMsg);
            // Email must be unique, no duplicates allowed
            document.getElementById("pswError").innerHTML =
                "Email already exists in the table";
            return;
        }
        // response contains valid result
        response.json().then(data => {
            console.log(data);
            //add a table row for the new/created userId
            const tr = document.createElement("tr");
            for (let key in data) {
                if (key !== 'query') {
                    //create a DOM element for the data(cells) in table rows
                    const td = document.createElement("td");
                    console.log(data[key]);
                    //truncate the displayed password to length 20
                    if (key === 'password'){
                        td.innerHTML = data[key].substring(0,17)+"...";
                    }
                    else{
                        td.innerHTML = data[key];}
                    //add the DOM data element to the row
                    tr.appendChild(td);
                }
            }
            //append the DOM row to the table
            table.appendChild(tr);
        })
    })
