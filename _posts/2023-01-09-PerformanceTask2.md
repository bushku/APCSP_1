description: HTML fragments are portions of code used in a greater coding system that enable functionality specific to the current page.  Fragments in HTML are a way to abstract complexity.  The greater coding system we use is GitHub Pages which uses Jekyll and Liquid to build and programmatically construct fragments into the larger web site.

## Submission 1

| Category     | Student Score | College Board Score | 
|--------- | ----------- | --------- | 
| Program Function and Purpose | 0 | 0 | 
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 |  
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 |   
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 |  
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | 
| Testing | 1 | 1 | 

Reflection: There are no discrepancies in my scoring versus the ap scoring. My program will need a lot of data abstraction and managing complexity. The submission failed to meet the standard because the CPT only fullfilled a few requirements.
