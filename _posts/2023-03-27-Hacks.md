## Answers to Hacks Questions
1. Time and space complexity are important when choosing an algorithm because they determine how much time and memory is required to solve a problem. An efficient algorithm requires less time and memory.

2. I should not always use a constant time algorithm, and I should never use an exponential time algorithm. The choice of an algorithm depends on a specific problem you are trying to solve and the trade-offs between time and space complexity. In some cases, a constant time algorithm may not be able to solve the problem efficiently, while in other cases, an exponential time algorithm may be the only practical solution. It is important to consider the constraints and requirements of the problem at hand when choosing an algorithm.

3. Some general patterns that I noticed to determine each algorithm's time and space complexity are recursive functions, analyzing loops, and nested data structures. To determine time complexity you need to count the number of operations executed by an algorithm related to/caused by the input size. To determine space complexity, you to analyze the amount of memory required to store data as a function of the input size.
