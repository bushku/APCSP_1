title:  5.1 and 5.2 Hacks on canvas
---

1. We identify a problem, solve the problem, and inspire the users to do it. Our problem is an unhealthy lifestyle. We solve this by calculating data that is later used to create a new lifestyle for the user. We inspire the user through facts and motivational user experience.
2. Every project has some loophole to be used for harm. The data gathered can result in a harmful user experience if it is not meeting the user's expectations.
3. The pro is that students are only able to put their attention on academics. The con is that in some classes, meaning all CTE classes requiring computers, students are not able to access the same tools that they can in real life, which strengthens the digital divide.
4. We should spend time out of each week or tech talk talking about ways to solve the digital divide so that the world is in balance.
