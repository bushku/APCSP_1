<p>Question 9: I got Step 3 right but I did not get Step 4 right. Since a list of numbers has n elements, indexed from 1 to n, the position has to be greater than n.</p>

<p>Question 16: I thought I picked “selection” but it turned out that I selected “searching”. I did not check that question properly.</p>

<p>Question 27: The question is a robot question. I was confused on that one. I answered B and the correct answer was D. The reason B is wrong is because after “Repeat 3 times”, there were two seperate codes before n &lt;- n + 1. I think I got this wrong because I was reading it a little fast and B just “seemed” right but I didn’t pay too much attention.</p>

<p>Question 30: I was asked to draw an image on a graph in two different ways. The reason A is incorrect is because it dras the circle before it changes the y value. This equation ould have made every circle one y space lower making it not match the graph. My thinking was that it didn’t start drawing the circle from the center rather the bottom.</p>
