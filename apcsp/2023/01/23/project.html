<h2 id="feature">
<a class="anchor" href="#feature" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Feature</h2>
<p>My feature is the BMI calculator. A solution to solving an unhealthy lifestyle is finding ways to regulate your body mass. To do this, you need to first find your body mass index. This problem is solved with our BMI Calculator, which will tell you, based on the input of your height weight, whether you are underweight, normal weight, or overweight for your index.</p>

<h2 id="code-plan">
<a class="anchor" href="#code-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code Plan</h2>
<p>I will talk to my groupmates about how lists will be incorporated in the code plan. The main idea for the code plan is to calculate the body mass index by using both weight and height of the person.  The procedure of the code includes calculating the body mass index with the famous BMI formula and stores that value with the user account if the user wishes.</p>

<h2 id="video-plan">
<a class="anchor" href="#video-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Video Plan</h2>
<p>For the BMI calculator, I will type in the weight and height of the person, and the BMI will show up.</p>

<p>When code is shown, computer is connect to wifi. It establishes a HTTP protocal. In Javascript, Fetch sends a request to the backend server and grabs data OR it will post data to the backend server.</p>
