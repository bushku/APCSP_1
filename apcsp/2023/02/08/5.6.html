<ol>
  <li>The most common PII are our names, github usernames, and information that we put in our projects (such as nutrition, BMI, and workouts).</li>
  <li>I am usually nervous sending my own information out, especially to social media. I feel that social media is bad for my brain because I am afraid of texting on social media. I feel that I am texting a stranger.</li>
  <li>Good passwords:
    <ul>
      <li>An English uppercase character (A-Z)</li>
      <li>An English lowercase character (a-z)</li>
      <li>A number (0-9) and/or symbol (such as !, #, or %)</li>
      <li>Ten or more characters total
Bad passwords:</li>
      <li>123456</li>
      <li>123456789</li>
      <li>Qwerty</li>
      <li>Password</li>
      <li>12345</li>
      <li>12345678</li>
      <li>111111</li>
      <li>1234567
Authentication steps:</li>
      <li>The user attempts to access an application.</li>
      <li>The user is redirected to the IdP to receive a verification code</li>
      <li>The user gives consent for the application to access
information from the idP</li>
      <li>The user submits the verification code to the application</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Symmetric encryption: a private key is used to encrypt
and decrypt an encrypted email 
Asymmetric encryption: the public key of the recipient is used to encrypt the message</li>
  <li>Encryption we used in AWS deployment - Asymmetric encryption
We had to generate the public and secret keys and then add them to our repositories.</li>
  <li>Last trimester right before night at the muesuem, I tried to make some last-minute changes to our project because I was really nervous. But then the team had a lot of problems. We could not access our own flask website. The error is related to the debug I made. I made this error happen, meaning I made those last-minute changes to or project. One of the twins (Ava or Alexa) told me that if I want to make any changes to our project, I have to ask the team first. In the upcoming night at the muesuem, I am going to stay calm and do my best to show a lot of people what we got in our project.</li>
