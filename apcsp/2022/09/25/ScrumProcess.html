<a class="anchor" href="#description-of-roles" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Description of Roles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Scrum Master: Helps to facilitate the sprint by ensuring that an agile framework is followed; Committed to tracking issues and maintaining scrum boards, but should also remain flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow.</li>
  <li>Frontend Developer: Builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—that is, the part that users actually see and interact with.</li>
  <li>DevOps: The combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an team’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: version control, integration, managing dependencies (requirements.txt), AWS deployment are some of the key functions that impact velocity.</li>
  <li>Backend Developer: Builds and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions like data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see</li>
</ul>

<p>Plan: First, my team meets up for going over the directions for each assignment. Then, we assign group roles. Then we meet up again daily to check our progress and post it on the scrum board on github, which is posted here:</p>
