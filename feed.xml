It involves outsourcing tasks to a large, undefined group of people, rather than to a specific individual or organization. Crowdsourcing is used in a variety of fields, including marketing, design, product development, and problem-solving, to tap into the collective intelligence and expertise of the crowd. The goal of crowdsourcing is to harness the power of many people to accomplish tasks that would be difficult or impossible for an individual or small group to complete.\n", "\n", "\n", "## **Obtaining Data via Crowdsourcing**\n", "\n", "\n", "> Crowdsourcing is the practice of gathering information or services from a large group of people, often via the internet, for a specific purpose. It enables organizations to quickly and cost-effectively gather large amounts of data.\n", "\n", "\n", "#### **Advantages of Crowdsourcing:**\n", "\n", "\n", "- Large and diverse pool of contributors\n", "- Can be cost-effective compared to traditional data collection methods\n", "- Allows for real-time data collection\n", "- Can reach hard-to-access populations or locations\n", "\n", "\n", "#### **Disadvantages of Crowdsourcing:**\n", "\n", "\n", "- Quality control issues, as data may not be validated\n", "- Bias in responses, as individuals may have their own biases\n", "- Lack of incentive for contributors to provide accurate data\n", "\n", "\n", "#### **Popular platforms for Crowdsourcing data:**\n", "\n", "\n", "- Amazon Mechanical Turk\n", "- CrowdFlower\n", "- Upwork\n", "## **Evidence of Crowdsourcing**\n", "\n", "\n", "> Crowdsourcing refers to the act of obtaining services or ideas from a large group of people, especially from the online community. There is a lot of evidence to support the use of crowdsourcing as a way to obtain valuable input and resources from a diverse group of individuals. Some of the most common types of evidence for crowdsourcing include:\n", "\n", "\n", "- **Increased Innovation:** Crowdsourcing often results in a large number of ideas being generated, many of which may be outside the box and not considered by traditional methods. This leads to increased innovation.\n", "\n", "\n", "- **Cost Savings:** Crowdsourcing can often be less expensive than traditional methods of gathering information or ideas. This is because the costs are spread among a large number of individuals, rather than being borne by a single entity.\n", "\n", "\n", "- **Increased Speed:** Crowdsourcing can often be faster than traditional methods of gathering information or ideas. This is because the process can be done in parallel, with many individuals working on different aspects of the problem at the same time.\n", "\n", "\n", "- **Improved Quality:** Crowdsourcing can result in improved quality, as a large number of individuals can review and provide feedback on the ideas generated. This leads to a more robust and well-vetted solution.\n", "\n", "\n", "- **Wider Reach:** Crowdsourcing enables organizations to reach a wider audience than they would be able to through traditional methods. This can result in a more diverse set of ideas and perspectives being gathered." ] } ], "metadata": { "language_info": { "name": "python" }, "orig_nbformat": 4 }, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2 }]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CPT Project Notes</title><link href="https://bushku.github.io/APCSP_1/2023/02/02/projectplan.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CPT Project Notes" /><published>2023-02-02T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-02T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://bushku.github.io/APCSP_1/2023/02/02/projectplan</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[These are my CPT project notes.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">5.4 Crowdsourcing</title><link href="https://bushku.github.io/APCSP_1/apcsp/2023/02/01/5.4.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="5.4 Crowdsourcing" /><published>2023-02-01T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://bushku.github.io/APCSP_1/apcsp/2023/02/01/5.4</id><author><name></name></author><category term="APCSP" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[These are my 5.4 notes]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">5.3 Tech Bias</title><link href="https://bushku.github.io/APCSP_1/apcsp/2023/02/01/5.3.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="5.3 Tech Bias" /><published>2023-02-01T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://bushku.github.io/APCSP_1/apcsp/2023/02/01/5.3</id><author><name></name></author><category term="APCSP" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[These are my 5.3 notes]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">5.1 and 5.2 Hacks on canvas</title><link href="https://bushku.github.io/APCSP_1/apcsp/2023/01/30/5.15.2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="5.1 and 5.2 Hacks on canvas" /><published>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://bushku.github.io/APCSP_1/apcsp/2023/01/30/5.15.2</id><author><name></name></author><category term="APCSP" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We identify a problem, solve the problem, and inspire the users to do it. Our problem is an unhealthy lifestyle. We solve this by calculating data that is later used to create a new lifestyle for the user. We inspire the user through facts and motivational user experience. Every project has some loophole to be used for harm. The data gathered can result in a harmful user experience if it is not meeting the userâ€™s expectations. The pro is that students are only able to put their attention on academics. The con is that in some classes, meaning all CTE classes requiring computers, students are not able to access the same tools that they can in real life, which strengthens the digital divide. We should spend time out of each week or tech talk talking about ways to solve the digital divide so that the world is in balance.]]></summary></entry></feed>
