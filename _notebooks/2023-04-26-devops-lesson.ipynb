    "\n",
    "1. Explain what CORS is and what it stands for\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a system, consisting of transmitting HTTP headers, that determines whether browsers block frontend JavaScript code from accessing responses for cross-origin resquests.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Describe how you would be able to implement CORS into your own websites\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: To do this, open the server/index. js file and modify it to look like the following: const express = require(\"express\"); const debug = require(\"debug\")(\"server\"); const app = express(); const port = process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe why you would want to implement CORS into your own websites\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: CORS allows more freedom and functionality than purely same-origin requests, but is more secure than simply allowing all cross-origin requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How could use CORS to benefit yourself in the future?\n",

    "# KASM Hacks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the purpose of \"sudo\" when running commands in terminal?\n",

    "Answer: The purpose of \"sudo\" when running commands in terminal is to get permission to run those commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are some commands which allow us to look at how the storage of a machine is set up as?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: One of the commands which allows us to look at how the storage of a machine is set up as is df -H.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What do you think are some alternatives to running \"curl -O\" to get the zip file for KASM?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Some alternatives to running \"curl -O\" are to manually download the zip file using \"wget\" or to download and transfer it through something like Google-Drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What kind of commands do you think the \"install.sh\" command has and why is it necessary to call it?\n",

    "- Downloading necessary files\n",

    "- Setting up environment\n",

    "5. Explain in at least 3-4 sentences how deploying KASM is related to/requires other topics talked about in the lesson and/or potential ways to add things mentioned in the lesson to this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Deploying KASM, the container-based streaming service, requires several components such as headers, NGINX, load balancing, configuration, DNS, and CORS. Headers are important for configuring security settings and enabling CORS for KASM. NGINX is used as a reverse proxy to handle incoming web traffic and load balancing is necessary for distributing the traffic among multiple server instances running KASM. Configuration is required to set up the KASM service and define the specific settings for the environment in which it will run.\n",
