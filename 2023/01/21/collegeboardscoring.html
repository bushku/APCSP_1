However, for the data abstraction category, I thought the student did not identify the variable representing the list that is being used in the response. It turned out that the student met all the requirements except the requirement where two segments were provided: The first segment shows data being stored in the identified
list, but the second segment does not show data being accessed from the list. Also for the managing complexity category, I thought the student met one of requirements, but it turns out that the student did not meet any of the requirements in that category.</p>

<h2 id="Reflection">Reflection<a class="anchor-link" href="#Reflection"> </a></h2><p>For the most part, college board and I seem to agree on what the scoring for most of the criteria should be, also in some of the categories, I was a bit too easy on that student. In the testing category, I thought the student fullfilled all the requirements. It turned out that the student wrote that the function described two calls from the specified procedure, not to the specified procedure. "from" and "to" mean different things. I was a bit confused on the data abstraction category. I thought the student earned points on that category. It turned out that the description the data contained in this list is representing in the program is inaccurate as the identified list stateList
appears to represent only the state name. The submission failed because for the most part, the student did not meet all the criteria.</p>

<h2 id="Reflection">Reflection<a class="anchor-link" href="#Reflection"> </a></h2><p>There are no discrepancies in my scoring versus the college board scoring. This project was simple to grade. My favorite part of the project was the program function and purpose category because the student mentioned that video demonstrates fishing gameplay with the boat movement, which reminded me of our CPT project because workouts are part of our project. For the most part, the submission did not fail because student fullfilled all the requirements except for the testing category.</p>
